# Sync

## Set up

* First of all, we need working installations of Elixir and Erlang. The easiest way to achieve this is via [Installation Page](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html).
* Set some required environment variables (see `.env.sample` file).

## Running

* Install Elixir and Node.js dependencies with `mix setup`
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`
* Visit `http://localhost:4000`

## Testing

You can run tests with `mix test`

## Things I should have done + Things I wanna improve

* Ask Aleksandra some more questions. I'm quite sure that the implementation I've done is not correct :(
* Make it more convenient when it comes to owner/repo configuration.
* Handle error cases more properly.
* Add more tests.
